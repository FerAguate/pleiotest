Description: It performs a fast multi-trait genome-wide association analysis based on seemingly unrelated regressions, and performs a test for pleiotropic effects based on a series of Intersection-Union Wald tests. The package offers some computational advantages that allows to handle large and unbalanced data, easy to interpret results, and plots.
